Assignment 1: SDLC Overview - Create a one-page infographic that outlines the SDLC phases (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment), 
highlighting the importance of each phase and how they interconnect.

Solution:

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Overview:
1. **Requirements**
   - Gathering client needs.
   - Understanding user expectations.
   - Documenting project scope.

2. **Design**
   - Architectural planning.
   - Creating system blueprints.
   - User interface (UI) design.

3. **Implementation**
   - Writing code.
   - Building software components.
   - Integrating functionalities.

4. **Testing**
   - Quality Assurance (QA) checks.
   - Identifying bugs and issues.
   - Ensuring software meets specifications.

5. **Deployment**
   - Launching the product.
   - Releasing updates and patches.
   - User training and support.

**Importance of Each Phase:**

- **Requirements:** Sets the foundation for the project, ensuring alignment between client expectations and development outcomes.
  
- **Design:** Shapes the blueprint of the software, guiding developers in creating a structured and efficient system.
  
- **Implementation:** Translates designs into functioning software, where code is written and features are built.
  
- **Testing:** Crucial for identifying and fixing defects, ensuring the software meets quality standards before deployment.
  
- **Deployment:** Marks the culmination of development efforts, launching the software for users while providing ongoing support and updates.

Interconnected Phases:

- Continuous Feedback Loop: Each phase provides insights and feedback for the next, ensuring alignment with project goals and client expectations.
  
- Iterative Development: Allows for adjustments and improvements throughout the cycle, enhancing the quality and functionality of the software.
