Assignment 4: Scrum Framework Overview - Prepare a one-page cheat sheet on the Scrum framework that includes roles, responsibilities, artifacts, and ceremonies. 
Provide a brief example of a Sprint task list for the earlier mentioned app project.

Solution:

Scrum is a management framework that teams use to self-organize and work towards a common goal. It describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles for efficient
 project delivery. Much like a sports team practicing for a big match, Scrum practices allow teams to self-manage, learn from experience, and adapt to change. 
Software teams use Scrum to solve complex problems cost effectively and sustainably. 

Scrum Framework Cheat Sheet

Roles:

Product Owner: Represents stakeholders, prioritizes backlog items, and ensures the team delivers value.
Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and fosters a collaborative team environment.
Development Team: Self-organizing group responsible for delivering increments of working product.

Responsibilities:

Product Owner: Defines product vision, creates and maintains the product backlog, and accepts or rejects completed work.
Scrum Master: Coaches the team on Scrum principles, facilitates meetings, and shields the team from external distractions.
Development Team: Estimates tasks, selects work for the sprint, collaborates on solutions, and delivers a potentially shippable product increment.

Artifacts:

Product Backlog: Prioritized list of all desired features, enhancements, and fixes for the product.
Sprint Backlog: Subset of the product backlog items selected for the sprint, along with tasks and commitments.
Increment: The sum of all product backlog items completed during a sprint, potentially shippable and ready for review.

Ceremonies:

Sprint Planning: Collaboratively plans the work to be done in the sprint, including selecting backlog items and defining tasks.
Daily Stand-up: Brief daily meeting where team members synchronize activities, discuss progress, and identify any impediments.
Sprint Review: Demo of the completed work from the sprint, gathering feedback from stakeholders.
Sprint Retrospective: Reflective meeting where the team discusses what went well, what could be improved, and actions for the next sprint.

Example Sprint Task List:
Implement user authentication feature
Design event scheduling interface
Develop database schema for storing event data
Create API endpoints for managing event details
Integrate payment gateway for ticket sales
Conduct usability testing on event registration flow
