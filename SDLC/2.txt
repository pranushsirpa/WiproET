Interviewer (You):** Good morning! Thank you for joining me today. Let's start by discussing your involvement in community events and how food delivery plays a role.

**Interviewee (Fictional Community Events Organizer):** Hi! I'm excited to be here. In our community events, food plays a significant role. We often host festivals, picnics, and fundraisers where attendees expect a variety of food options.

**Interviewer:** That sounds like a wonderful community engagement opportunity. What challenges do you face regarding food logistics during these events?

**Interviewee:** One challenge is ensuring that we have a diverse range of food vendors available to cater to different tastes and dietary preferences. Coordinating with vendors, managing orders, and ensuring timely delivery can be quite hectic.

**Interviewer:** Understood. So, you're looking for a food delivery app tailored to the needs of community events. Can you outline the specific features you're envisioning?

**Interviewee:** Absolutely. Firstly, we need a platform where event organizers can browse and select from a curated list of food vendors. The app should allow vendors to showcase their menus, availability, and pricing.

**Interviewee:** Event organizers should be able to:
1. Browse and search for food vendors by cuisine type and availability.
2. View vendor profiles with menus, pricing, and reviews.
3. Place orders for catering services directly through the app.
4. Track order statuses and delivery schedules in real-time.

**Interviewer:** Excellent. Now, for the food vendors themselves, what capabilities would they require?

**Interviewee:** Vendors should be able to:
1. Create profiles with detailed information about their offerings.
2. Manage their menus, availability, and pricing.
3. Receive and manage orders placed by event organizers.
4. Communicate with organizers regarding order details and logistics.

**Interviewer:** Got it. In terms of logistics and delivery, what considerations should we take into account?

**Interviewee:** Timely delivery is crucial, so the app should include features for:
1. Efficient order dispatch and routing.
2. Real-time tracking of delivery drivers.
